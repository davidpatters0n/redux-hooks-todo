This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What this project is

A simple TODO application. The purpose of this was for me to extend my existing redux knowledge and learn how to use Redux+Hooks

In the project directory, you can run:
### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
